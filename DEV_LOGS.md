Format:
- YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC — action — result

2026-02-12 22:59 UTC — governance baseline seeded from SoT — required artifacts created/synced
2026-02-13 07:02 UTC — governance: roadmap observability marker synced for drift alignment
2026-02-13 08:30 UTC — governance: restart semantics normalized (ACTIVE -> Phase 1 EXPORT, NEW -> Phase 2 IMPORT) [restart-semantics-unified-v1]
2026-02-13 07:24 UTC — governance: protocol sync header rolled out (source=RADRILONIUMA-PROJECT version=v1.0.0 commit=7eadfe9) [protocol-sync-header-v1]
2026-02-16 07:26 UTC — governance: protocol hard-rule synced (`global-final-publish-step-mandatory-v1`) — final close step fixed as mandatory `git push origin main`; `COMPLETE` requires push evidence.
2026-02-16 07:56 UTC — governance: workflow optimization protocol sync (`workflow-optimization-protocol-sync-v2`) — enforced `M46`, manual intervention fallback, and `ONE_BLOCK_PER_OPERATOR_TURN` across repository protocol surfaces.
2026-02-17 01:42 UTC — architecture stabilization — moved target-resolution logic to pure module (`jarvis_core.py`) and switched to lazy agent initialization in `main.py` to avoid import-time heavy side effects.
2026-02-17 01:42 UTC — test expansion — added `pytest.ini`, test bootstrap (`tests/conftest.py`), governance checks and core mapping tests; validation: `5 passed`.
2026-02-17 01:42 UTC — operations — added deterministic test runner (`scripts/test_entrypoint.sh`) and synchronized README model/test instructions.
2026-02-19 14:30 UTC — Phase 8.0: Orchestration Resolution Healing Initiated. Goal: Enable J.A.R.V.I.S to resolve commands targeting 24 sovereign subtrees and synchronize Task t112.
